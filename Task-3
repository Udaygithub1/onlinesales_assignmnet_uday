Given below is a Bash / Python script that performs following computation on an integer input (n):
If n is less than 10: Calculate its Square
Example: 4 => 16
If n is between 10 and 20: Calculate the factorial of (n-10)
Example: 15 => 120
If n is greater than 20: Calculate the sum of all integers between 1 and (n-20)
Example: 25 => 15


Answer:-

# The provided Bash and Python scripts contain a bug in the factorial calculation section. 
# To fix the bug in the Python script, you need to change the range in the for loop to range(1, n-10+1). 
# The upper limit should be n-10+1 to include the last value in the range.


def compute(n):
    if n < 10:
        out = n ** 2
    elif n < 20:
        out = 1
# here we can change range from n-10 to n-10+1 and for understanding
# The purpose of this loop is to calculate the factorial of (n-10). The range specified in the loop is correct, starting from 1 and iterating up to (n-10)-1.
# For example, if n = 15, the loop should iterate from 1 to 4 (excluding 5) because (n-10) is equal to 5.
        for i in range(1, n-10+1):
# or we can also use range(1, n-9)
            out *= i
    else:
        lim = n - 20
        out = lim * lim
        out = out - lim
        out = out / 2 
    print(out)


n = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
compute(n)
