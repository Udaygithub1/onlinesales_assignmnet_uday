Given below is a Bash / Python script that performs following computation on an integer input (n):
If n is less than 10: Calculate its Square
Example: 4 => 16
If n is between 10 and 20: Calculate the factorial of (n-10)
Example: 15 => 120
If n is greater than 20: Calculate the sum of all integers between 1 and (n-20)
Example: 25 => 15


Answer:-

The provided Bash and Python scripts contain a bug in the factorial calculation section. 
To fix it, you need to change the comparison operator "<" to "<=" in the loop condition.
Here's the corrected version of the script:

def compute(n):
    if n < 10:
        out = n ** 2
    elif n < 20:
        out = 1
   # Change the loop range to n-10+1
        for i in range(1, n-10+1): 
  
            out *= i
    else:
        lim = n - 20
        out = lim * lim
        out = out - lim
        out = out / 2 
    print(out)


n = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
